# Renaming the default branch from `master`

Many communities, both on GitHub and in the wider Git community, are considering renaming the default branch name of their repository from `master`. GitHub is gradually renaming the default branch of our own repositories from `master` to `main`. We're committed to making the renaming process as seamless as possible for project maintainers and all of their contributors. This repository is our up-to-date guidance on how and when to rename your default branch.

We're not the only organization in the Git ecosystem making these changes: there are upcoming changes in the Git project ([statement](https://sfconservancy.org/news/2020/jun/23/gitbranchname/), [code change](https://lore.kernel.org/git/pull.656.v4.git.1593009996.gitgitgadget@gmail.com/)), as well as coordinated changes from multiple vendors.

Weâ€™re making changes to GitHub in a few phases, designed to cause as little disruption to existing projects as possible.

**If you havenâ€™t renamed your default branch yet, consider waiting until [later this year](#later-this-year). Weâ€™re investing in tools to make renaming the default branch of an existing repository a seamless experience for both maintainers and contributors.**

## What's already changed

- [We've updated GitHub.com](https://github.blog/changelog/2020-07-17-links-to-deleted-branches-now-redirect-to-the-default-branch/) to redirect links that contain the deleted branch name `master` to the corresponding link in the repository's new default branch.
- [We've updated GitHub Pages](https://github.blog/changelog/2020-07-31-build-and-deploy-github-pages-from-any-branch-beta/) to build and deploy from any branch.
  - Note: publishing to the special `gh-pages` branch will still work the same as it always has, but now you can choose any other branch in your repository as the publishing source.
- [We've added user, organization, and enterprise settings](https://github.blog/changelog/2020-08-26-set-the-default-branch-for-newly-created-repositories/) to set the default branch name for all newly-created repositories on GitHub.com. We're adding the same settings in the 2.23 release of GitHub Enterprise Server.
  - These settings cover repositories created through [GitHub.com](https://github.com/new) and the [GitHub API](https://developer.github.com/v3/guides/getting-started/#create-a-repository). Git 2.28 added a similar setting to control the default branch used when you run `git init` on the command line. Learn more about the new `init.defaultBranch` setting in [the Git 2.28 blog post](https://github.blog/2020-07-27-highlights-from-git-2-28/#introducing-init-defaultbranch).
  - [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) will also introduce a default branch setting for new repositories later this month.

## New repositories use `main` as default branch name

The default branch name for new repositories is now `main`. To set a different default:

1. For [users](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/managing-the-default-branch-name-for-your-repositories), on the https://github.com/settings/repositories page
2. For [organization owners](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/managing-the-default-branch-name-for-repositories-in-your-organization), on the `https://github.com/organizations/YOUR-ORGANIZATION/settings/repository-defaults` page
3. For [enterprise administrators](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-enterprise-account/enforcing-repository-management-policies-in-your-enterprise-account#enforcing-a-policy-on-the-default-branch-name), on the `https://github.com/enterprises/YOUR-ENTERPRISE/settings/member_privileges` page

Users, organizations, and enterprise that previously selected a default branch for new repositories are not impacted by this change.

Existing repositories are not impacted by this change. [Later this year](#later-this-year), you'll be able to rename the default branch for existing repositories for your user, organization, or enterprise account.

#### Why main?

`main` is the most popular replacement for `master` that weâ€™re seeing across GitHub. We like it because itâ€™s short, it keeps your muscle memory intact, and it translates well across most languages. Weâ€™re using `main` for our newly-created repositories and for the repositories weâ€™re moving now, like [dependabot-core](https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core).

## Later this year: seamless move for existing repositories ðŸš€

For existing repositories, renaming the default branch today causes a set of challenges:

- Open pull requests need to be retargeted to the new branch
- Draft releases need to be retargeted to the new branch
- Branch protection policies need to be transferred to the new branch
- GitHub pages settings.
- CI code tied to specific branches.
- Redirects for documentation pointing to source code at the master branch.

By the end of the year, we'll make it seamless for existing repositories to rename their default branch. When you rename the branch, weâ€™ll retarget your open PRs and draft releases, move your branch protection policies, and more - all automatically. And, weâ€™re also looking into redirecting users who `git fetch` or `git clone` the old branch name to the new branch name (with a warning and instructions to update their local clone), so itâ€™s easy for your contributors to move.
